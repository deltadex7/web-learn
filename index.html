        A simple paragraph for your needs. Typing it here may <span>span</span>
        multiple lines, but won't break on the page unless explicitly <br> broken.
        But hey, this one is experimental, so keep going on the same line.

        <p id="icon-details">
            The icon composed of Arch Linux on top of KDE Neon. Using Krita, 
            the image is grayed out and recolored as needed to achieve near 
            Arch-blue color. That color also affected the Neon icon, which is 
            a side effect of the grayscale earlier in the edit.
